Course Review

.lower #prints variable in lower case
.upper #prints var in upper case
test = "Taco"
test.lower()
print(test)
#output is 'taco'

to capitalize first letter only
w = 'banana'
w[0] = w[0].upper()
w[1:] = w[1].lower)

or try using .title()

data structures - lists and dicts
Lists are ordered and start at zero.
dicts - key/value pairs

tuples - like a list and index them and assign var but can't append to them.  - a pair of things that are together. 

can declare a list as empty with []
or you can start a list with what you want it to be

empty dict {}
{'key': 'value'}


Student Database: of python students
pStud = {'abc@gmail.com': 'Michael', 
        'bcd@gmail.com': 'Jeff',
        'hij@gmail.com': 'Harry'
}
dictionary in a dictionary
pStud = {'abc@gmail.com': {name: 'Michael', 'acct_num': '123'}
        'bcd@gmail.com': {name': 'Jeff', 'acct_num': '567'}
        'hij@gmail.com': {'name': 'Harry', 'acct_num': '789'}
}
output ?:
pstud['abc@gmail.com']['name']

use json for api's
json.dump 

for loop - for everything in this list or dict do something #everything can be named anything

can also do for i in range  do something #starts at zero and i can be called anything

use for loop if you know how long you want to do something - only do this once if it's true - for i in range(20) - do it 20 times

use while loop if you don't know how long - keep doing this as long as it's true
break should be used with while loops to stop it. 
can put a try/except instead of break - whenever you get to except you say break

to find something in a string
test = 'Banana'
if 'n' in test:
    print('yes')
    
    or
    
val = test.find('n')
if val >= 1: #1 represents yes ?
    print('yes')
    
functions with defaults 
parameters must be in same order 

def fun2(ban, taco = 1)
print(ban * taco)

fun2(0, 4)
#ban is 0 and taco is 4 and multiplying them is zero

fun2('hi', 2)
#this gives error cuz can't multiply string and integer/number

csv library comes with python

with open('my_csv_input.csv') as readFile:
    reader = csv.reader(readFile) #gives a list of lists - with data in each cell
    next(reader) #skip titles on row (read any file you are working with )
    
for i, row in enumerate(reader): #more advanced for loop. for i in range, however long reader is - enumerate the rows adn tell me which row I"m on assigned to value i
    print(row) #prints data on row
    print(i) #prints the row number we are on

clean data
ask yourself what data do you need for code to work so you don't put in data that you don't need 
always make a copy, don't change original data

could store in dictionary where any duplicates would be overwritten cuz only one key/value 

Try adn Except
try adn do something but if it's not working then it's an exception to rule..
except is if try doesn't work. Then we will run the code "didn't work"

else - print whatever - this is if Try did work

APIs
Application Program Interface - if I have connected device or an app they likley have an api so you can get info from them 
like - weather api - what time is sunrise, if that time is now, play this song or on another - send this email.
Roku Tv has an API
if steps were more than 7500 turn on tv re; fitness apps

tiers of api - may or may not be up to date or very often if on free version

throttling is wht companies do when you call them with api's too often and they slow you down to try to get you to upgrade 

kayak.com and skyscanner has an api for flight prices - if price now is less than or more than $20 send me an email

twilio api for text message - free or low from django.conf import settings

if this then that ifttt - tons of services - airtable integrations
vsync smart lights 
webhook gives you a custom url - you can tell skyscanner to go url 
chromium gets all html data - when it's "open" then you can tell it do something
don't let computers/ai have your credit card and buy things for you
have them tell you how to buy it 
rapid ai 
yonomi
zappier for business
slack 

bots could be used to buy concert tix but advise against it cuz mistakes in code coudl happen and then buy thousands accidentally
Github - grab code
PY image search - computer vision, face tracking, detecting if sleep at wheel 
Medium - blog posts and articles about what they built - you can take their code and make it better
youtube - videos on CS 
Libraries and APIs for gamil, fitbit, sensors, smart home type python api and whatever you want
Intermediate class at Stanford could be your next step
