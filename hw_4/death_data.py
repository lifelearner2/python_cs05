'''
First: Crawl the web for a dataset that you are interested in. Could be a companyâ€™s stock, temperature in a town over the last few years, the price of Coca-Cola over the years, etc, download as csv.

Next: Create a trend line (degree 1) to fit to the data with numpy. Then estimate the future values, bonus if you allow users to ask for specific future values.

You can reference the python file from this past lecture found on the Files page

Finally: Play around with different degrees to get a good fit
